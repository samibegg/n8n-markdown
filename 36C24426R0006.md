# Qualifications Checklist Review
### **Key Flags and Disqualifiers (per Powerlink criteria):**

- **Contract Structure:** Acceptable (5-year term, no union/fee/pay reputation issues flagged, commercial service delivery)
- **Operational Capacity:** Subject to ability to cover nine counties. Requires sufficient local capability.
- **Financial/Insurance:** SDVOSB set-aside may narrow pool. Insurance not excessive per usual VA transportation contracts (review full documents for specifics).
