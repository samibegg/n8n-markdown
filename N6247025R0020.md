## 9. Qualification/Disqualification Checklist — KEY EXTRACTS
- **Disqualifiers:**
   - Outside EVS/Dietary/Transport/Housekeeping/Facility Services/Laundry (RELEVANT, THIS IS WITHIN SCOPE)
   - Clinical/medical care required (NOT APPLICABLE)
   - Requires on-site management (APPLICABLE)
   - Site: Non-US (Sigonella, Italy) — **NOTE: Preference for US-based; overseas is not a disqualifier but introduces logistics and labor challenges**
   - Requires specialized capital assets (UNCLEAR w/o full review—most BOS contracts require some but not “capital assets” in the hospital sense)
   - Excessive bonding/insurance (Check; appears standard)
   - Lowest-cost-only evaluation (NOT THE CASE: Non-price factors used)

- **Flags:**
   - Site location outside US (extra compliance, workforce/labor, legal complexity)
   - Union agreements—Italy is a regulated labor market
   - Direct patient care (NOT REQUIRED)
   - Transition/startup period up to 60 days, not a disqualifier

- **Qualifiers:**
   - Fit to company’s core service lines (yes)
   - Acceptable contract terms (presumed, but local law must be reviewed)
   - Not lowest-bid only

---

## 10. Recommendation
### **DECLINE**

**Rationale:**
- The opportunity is overseas (Italy) and not within the United States, which is a stated disqualifier for Powerlink’s near-term pursuit matrix — unless strategic exception is made. The labor/regulatory environment in Sicily, Italy introduces significant complexity, risk, and administrative cost, alongside requirements for host nation labor compliance, local anti-mafia certification, and currency remittance challenges.
- If executive management’s strategic goals have shifted to permit pursuit outside the continental United States (CONUS), this contract is otherwise a strong fit service-wise, with no clinical requirement and otherwise standard government insurance terms. **However, the base location and overseas context are red-flagged unless pre-cleared by Powerlink leadership.**

---

## 11. Action Items
- If reconsideration is requested, conduct a detailed risk review on Italian labor law, host-nation statutes, certifications, and local union requirements before further pursuit.
