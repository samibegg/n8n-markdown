## Qualification Review Against Powerlink Criteria
**Category**
- This is a government food services contract—within Powerlink’s target categories (EVS/Dietary/Food Service). 
- Not outside of core services; fits within operational scope.

**Location**
- United States, in DC (not NY, CA, or IL)—NO location disqualifier.

**Eligibility/Structure**
- No indication of problem contract terms or union issues at the RFI stage.
- No appropriated funding: revenue is entirely from vendor sales; must assess risk profile.

**Operational Capacity**
- Facility (~1.7M sq. ft.; ~6,500 population; multi-concept food court with complex requirements) is significant and matches large-scale experience.
- All management on-site, many subfranchises/vendors—requires robust oversight ability.

**Timeline**
- RFI window is only 8 days—from posted date to deadline (tight, but not a formal proposal).

**Compliance & Risk**
- Standard commercial insurance requirements—no excessive insurance.
- Security requirements: all employees U.S. citizens.

**Financial**
- Revenue only from sales, no government payments; must weigh internal financial confidence based on business case projections.
- No lowest-cost-only evaluation yet (RFI/table-setting).

**Other**
- Randolph Sheppard is NOT a factor.
- No unique or prohibitive capital asset requirements known from the RFI.

---

## Recommendation
### **APPROVE pursuing this opportunity for formal proposal consideration, contingent on positive internal review of financials from a no-cost-to-government sales model.**
- The RFI poses no outright disqualifiers per Powerlink’s criteria.
- Insurance, scope, scale, structure, and compliance are all within normal parameters.
- Submit a strong capability statement and review attachment details for future potential solicitation.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Review the draft SOW and attachments for any hidden operational or compliance red flags.
- Prepare and submit the RFI response by **November 18, 2025, 2:00 PM ET**.
