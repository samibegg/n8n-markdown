## 11. Final Recommendation

### **APPROVE** for Pursuit

- **Reasoning:** The opportunity falls well within standard scope (on-site, no clinical care, no specialized capital assets, not product-only). The timeline is adequate, terms fit established models, and required documents are standard. Only minor flags for insurance level details and lowest-cost selection—neither rise to disqualifier status for initial review.
- **Action:** Confirm insurance specifics and submit complete package before the deadline.
