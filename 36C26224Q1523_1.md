## Final Recommendation

### **Recommendation: DECLINE**
**Reasoning:** California is listed as a disqualifier in the Opportunity Qualification/Disqualification Checklist (see: "Disqualifier: Located in NY, CA, or IL"). Unless leadership overrides this red-tag disqualifier for federal contracts in CA, the opportunity is outside standard pursuit criteria. Additionally, the solicitation requires strong local service capacity, full regulatory compliance, and stringent program start deadlines.

- **If override is considered, pursue only with explicit leadership approval as there are no automatic operational barriers and the scope is within transport/services.**
- **If following criteria strictly, standard policy is to decline based solely on location.**
- **For SDVOSB-registered businesses with full CA operational licensing, insurance, and ability to comply, this may qualify as a “flag for leadership review” rather than unconditional decline.**
