## 11. Qualification/Disqualification Screening (from Checklist)

| Factor                                | Result      |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Scope: Transport/Support Service       | Qualifier   |
| Union Agreements/Asset Requirements    | Not restrictive/No flag|
| Location: California                   | **Disqualifier** |
| SDVOSB Eligibility                     | Mandatory   |
| Insurance & Licensing                  | Must comply |
| Mobilization/Capacity                  | Must meet requirements |
| Proposal Window (>2 weeks)             | Acceptable  |

> **Note:** "Located in NY, CA, or IL" is red-tagged as a disqualifier on internal checklist, unless overridden for federal contracts with leadership approval.

---

## 12. Final Recommendation

### **Recommendation: DECLINE**

- **Reason:** According to the internal qualification checklist ("Disqualifier: Located in NY, CA, or IL"), opportunities located in California are subject to automatic decline unless specifically overridden by leadership for federal contracts.
- **If leadership override is an option:** This opportunity matches our operational scope (transport, non-clinical) and could be reconsidered for pursuit if leadership authorizes a location exception.

**Otherwise, based on standing qualification policy, we do not pursue solicitations in California without explicit leadership instruction.**

---

## 13. Action Items

- **If override approved:** Review full solicitation, confirm operational, insurance, and regulatory compliance for SDVOSB, and proceed to proposal preparation.
- **If following standard policy:** Do not pursue; file as declined.
