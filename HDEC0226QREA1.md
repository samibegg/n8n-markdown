## Powerlink Qualifications Checklist Review

- **Scope & Fit:** This opportunity is for food product resale (seafood), NOT EVS/Dietary/Transport/Housekeeping/Facility Services/Laundry.
- **Disqualifiers Identified:**  
  - Outside EVS/dietary/service scope (SEAFOOD PRODUCT/RETAIL)
  - Requires retail/resale operation (product purchasing/sales) rather than service delivery.
- **Location:** In the U.S. (meets geographic qualifier), but primary scope disqualifies for Powerlink business model.
- **Insurance, compliance, financials:** No adverse flags found, but opportunity remains disqualified due to scope.

## Final Recommendation

> ## **DECLINE**
>
> **Reason:**  
> The solicitation is solely focused on **resale operations for seafood products** and "roadshow" events—outside of Powerlink's service-oriented business focus (EVS, Dietary, Housekeeping, Facility Services, Laundry). Opportunity is specifically for product purchasing/resale, which is a stated disqualifier in the qualification checklist.  
>
> No further action recommended unless service scope or requirements change substantially.
