## 6. Qualifications/Disqualifications Assessment

### From Powerlink Opportunity Checklist:

#### Disqualifiers:
- Located **outside the United States** (France).
- Not in scope for EVS/Dietary/Transport/Facility Services in the U.S.
- Foreign union agreements or local labor laws/requirements may be complex.
- May involve additional compliance/risk for international work (insurance, legal, etc).

#### Qualifiers:
- Proposal window is >2 weeks.
- Commercial services RFP (janitorial—generally within scope for facility services).
- No indication of specialized capital assets or excessive bonding.
- Contract term likely ≥1 year (not confirmed).

#### Flags:
- Off-site management might be an issue if oversight requires on-site presence in France.
- Insurance requirements unknown—possible risk.
- Payment and legal jurisdiction: need to assess if payments will be reliable and in U.S. dollars/euro, and if contract compliance/logistics are manageable for U.S.-based firms.

## 7. Recommendation

### **Final Decision: DECLINE**

#### **Summary Reasoning:**
- **Disqualifiers:** The opportunity is a janitorial services solicitation **located outside the United States** (France), which is a direct disqualifier according to our qualification checklist.
- **Additional Considerations:** Off-site/international management, unknown insurance/capital/labor requirements, and lack of clarity regarding U.S. compliance may pose significant execution and risk barriers.
- **Recommendation:** Do not pursue unless company leadership specifically overrides standard geographic qualification policy for strategic reasons. For future reference, solicitations for services outside the U.S. are generally not in scope.

---

## 8. Action Items

- **Record Decline:** Decline opportunity per standard policy.
- **Optional (if interested):** Request full insurance and compliance requirements from Contracting Officer if leadership considers exception.
