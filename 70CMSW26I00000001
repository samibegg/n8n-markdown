## Insurance Requirements

- **Not specified** in summary; government contracts usually require general liability and food-service safety coverage. Details must be confirmed in the complete RFP.

---

## Submission Requirements

- Capability statement and company information (business size, UEI).
- Comply with all submission and operational directions per solicitation and SOW.

---

## Final Recommendation

### **DECLINE**

**Rationale:**  
- **Location is in Illinois (IL), which is a hard disqualifier per internal qualification criteria.**
- **Proposal window is less than two weeks – another disqualifying factor based on timeline standards for pursuit.**

Other requirements (facility service, dietary, food safety, etc.) align with standard service capabilities, but primary fit criteria do not permit pursuit per the internal checklist.

---

## Next Steps

- Do NOT pursue this opportunity.
- If there is a policy override or location flexibility, revisit upon leadership review.

---

*Stored for record: Do not pursue due to Illinois location and short response window per qualification matrix.*
