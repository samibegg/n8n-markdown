## Qualification/Disqualification Analysis
### Fit with Powerlink Checklist:
- **Category/Scope:** Transportation Broker (not EVS, Dietary, Housekeeping, Facility Services, or Laundry); not disqualified on category alone, but this is outside Powerlink’s primary operational scope
- **Geography:** Located in Maine (not NY, CA, IL)
- **Contract Terms:** Acceptable annual ceiling, not lowest-cost-only, payment via EFT, complies with federal terms
- **Timeline:** Adequate proposal window (>2 weeks); transition/startup not specified (warrants confirmation)
- **Compliance/Insurance:** Somewhat complex insurance due to data breach reimbursement, but not excessive or uninsurable
- **Union/Assets:** No union indication; does not specify capital assets
- **Financial Evaluation:** RFP includes scoring, not just lowest-cost
- **Risk:** No known excessive bonding, litigation history, or protest risk identified
- **Operational Capacity:** Transportation broker scope is outside Powerlink’s standard EVS/Facility model. If leadership prioritizes expansion to non-core services, may pursue as compliant federal contract.

---

## Final Recommendation
**Recommendation:**
> **DECLINE** this solicitation, as it is outside Powerlink’s primary operational scope (no EVS/Dietary/Housekeeping/Facility Services/Laundry component; the service is for transportation broker management only). Unless leadership specifically wishes to pursue expansion into transportation contract management for federal clients, this opportunity is not a fit for our target portfolio. 

If further clarification or override is warranted by business development, leadership should provide justification for pursuing outside-standard-scope IDIQ transportation contracts.
