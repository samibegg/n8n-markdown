## Qualifications Review

**Fit to Powerlink Qualifications Checklist:**

- **Category:** Government (IHS, federal)
- **Scope & Fit:** EVS/Laundry/Facility-related (in scope for Powerlink)
- **Location:** Kayenta, AZ (qualifies; not NY, CA, or IL)
- **Operational Capacity:** Standard laundry/EVS requirements; no volume thresholds flagged
- **Compliance & Risk:** No excessive insurance or direct patient care; compliance risk low
- **Financial Viability:** Not lowest-cost-only; formal solicitation not yet posted, financial terms TBD
- **Timeline:** Proposal window = ~9 days (<2 weeks), which is a *disqualification per checklist* unless leadership override
- **Union Agreements:** Not mentioned; single-site environmental service
- **Insurance:** Not specified in the sources sought; could arise in actual RFP

**Flags/Disqualifiers:**
- **Disqualifier:** Proposal window is short (<2 weeks); only 9 days to respond. This can be overridden by leadership for priority pursuit.
- **Insurance:** No info—may need confirmation in the formal solicitation.
- **Not a procurement yet:** This is market research, not a guaranteed bid/RFP.

---

## Insurance Requirements

- **None specified in the sources sought notice.** Formal requirements may be set in the real solicitation.

---

## Special Notes

- **SAM.gov registration required.**
- **IHS IEE Representation Form required only if claiming Indian status.**
- **Information provided in the response is for market research only; not a guarantee of future business.**

## Final Recommendation

### ❗ **Recommendation: APPROVE for Consideration with Leadership Review**

- **Rationale:** Scope fits Powerlink’s capabilities (laundry/EVS services, facility location); no immediate compliance, risk, or capitalization concerns. The only significant checklist disqualifier is the short response timeline, which may be permissible via a leadership override if this opportunity aligns with strategic priorities (e.g., furthering federal or Native American set-aside work).
- **Next Steps:** Prepare response with all required documentation and register intent. Monitor for release of formal solicitation for insurance and other compliance updates.
