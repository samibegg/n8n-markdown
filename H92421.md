## Qualifications & Disqualifiers Review

- **Scope & Fit:** Catering/food service (EVS/dietary), fits Powerlink’s core work.
- **Location:** Barnwell, SC – within eligible regions (not NY, CA, or IL).
- **Timeline:** Proposal window is short (~6 days from posting); urgent but not an automatic disqualifier.
- **Operational Capacity:** Meal volume is within standard catering/rations capability.
- **Compliance & Risk:** No direct patient/medical care; ServSafe requires food safety standards.
- **Financial:** No “lowest-cost only” evaluation; price and other factors considered.
- **Insurance/Bonding:** Not listed as excessive, but final review of PWS is advised.
- **Union Requirements / Specialized Assets:** Not specified; typically not relevant in short-term catering contexts.
- **Eligibility:** Standard DoD contract terms, SAM registration, responsible payment history.

---
