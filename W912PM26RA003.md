## Operational and Compliance Considerations (Per Qualification Criteria)
### Disqualifiers
- Service scope is **not outside core EVS/Dietary/Facility Services** – O&M fits within Facilities Support model
- **Direct patient care not required**
- **No evidence** contract is for product purchasing
- **Not located in NY, CA, or IL**  
- The contract duration is 1 year (meets minimum requirement)
- **Proposal window** is more than two weeks (pass)
- **No union, off-site laundry, clinical, or lowest-cost-only flags** found
### Flags/Unknowns
- Insurance/bonding limits **not provided directly** – may need review for "excessive" requirements

---

## Final Recommendation
### **APPROVE TO PURSUE**
#### Reasoning:
- Meets core qualifications for operational scope, location, duration, and eligibility as an 8(a) set-aside.
- No major disqualifiers noted.
- Insurance is not specified, but typically manageable for similar federal O&M contracts (should be reviewed upon full document access).
- Scope is clearly within Powerlink’s standard model (Facilities Support Services).
- Contact and submission structure are standard; all qualifications on compliance, proposal window, and performance term are satisfied.

---

## Action Items
1. **Review complete solicitation package** (including Performance Work Statement and insurance clauses) for final compliance.
2. Track amendment(s), as proposal due date has changed.
3. Confirm insurance/bonding levels upon PWS review.
4. Prepare technical proposal and certifications per instructions.
