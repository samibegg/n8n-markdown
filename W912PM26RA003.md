## Qualification Review

### Category Fit
- **Type:** Government Service Contract — fits Powerlink's core approach if O&M scope falls within Facility/Housekeeping/EVS and not clinical/medical care.

### Disqualifiers Checked
- Out-of-scope if requiring clinical/medical care (not indicated here).
- Located in NC (qualifies geo-location).
- Not a product purchases-only RFP; service delivery required.
- No union agreements or specialized capital assets flagged.
- No indication of excessive insurance or bond requirements—however, verify upon full review of the insurance section in attachments.
- Contract term is 1 year; meets minimum.
- No immediate flags for poor payment reputation or lowest-cost-only basis, but verify upon detailed review of proposal instructions/evaluation criteria.

## Final Recommendation

**Approve for Consideration**

Pending verification of insurance and bonding requirements within full solicitation attachments, this opportunity meets qualification criteria for category, scope, operational fit, location, submission timeline, and structure. No disqualifying flags surfaced from the summary context.
