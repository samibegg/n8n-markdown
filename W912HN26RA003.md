#### **APPROVAL: QUALIFIED TO PURSUE — Pending Confirmation of Insurance Requirements and Scope Boundaries**

- **Summary:** Solicitation aligns with typical service contract opportunities and does not currently trigger any major Powerlink disqualifiers. The scope, location, contract type, and timeline meet the checklist criteria. Grounds/landscape maintenance requires further review against standard business model.
- **Next Step:** Review the full solicitation and technical provisions once posted on PIEE/SAM.gov for confirmed insurance requirements and final scope breakdown. Clarify whether landscape/grounds services are manageable under Powerlink operational standards and whether insurance provisions are reasonable.
