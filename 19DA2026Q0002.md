## Qualifications Review (per Powerlink checklist)
- **Scope & Fit:** Opportunity is for food service/cook services, which fits the typical scope. However, **International Location (Denmark) may be flagged/disqualified per Powerlink qualification—which prioritize U.S. locations unless specifically approved.**
- **Operational Capacity:** On-site food preparation is required and fits the requirement. No off-site/clinical/medical care involved.
- **Timeline:** Full details pending official release, but expected contract term is at least one year.
- **Compliance & Risk:** Insurance requirements not known; check for excessive bonding/insurance on release. Government contract—acceptable if other flags are cleared.
- **Financial Viability:** Pricing details, ceilings, and evaluation criteria will be defined in full solicitation.

---

## Final Recommendation
### **DECLINE: Disqualified due to Location (Denmark) and non-U.S. scope per Powerlink checklist criteria.**
- Unless there is specific leadership override or strategic reason to pursue non-U.S. embassy cook services, this opportunity does not fit the current qualification screening criteria.

**Monitor SAM.gov for further updates, but recommend declining pursuit of Solicitation 19DA2026Q0002 at this time.**
