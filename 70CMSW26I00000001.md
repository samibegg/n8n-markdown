### Issues Found
- **Location:** Contracts in IL are flagged as disqualifiers by the qualification tool, unless waived by leadership.
- **Timeline:** Response window is less than 2 weeks (4 days), which is noted as a disqualifier for Powerlink standard operations.
- **Otherwise, the solicitation aligns with capabilities in DMV operations, dietary service, and security/compliance structures.**

## Final Recommendation

**DECLINE**

- The opportunity is flagged for disqualification due to:
  - **Location:** IL contracts are flagged as out-of-scope/undesired.
  - **Timeline:** Response window (<2 weeks) is below standard operations threshold, providing insufficient time for thorough proposal preparation.

If leadership wishes to override these flags (especially the geographic restriction), it may be reconsidered. Operationally, the opportunity fits most requirements for a food service provider, but as per established qualification criteria, this solicitation should be **declined**.
